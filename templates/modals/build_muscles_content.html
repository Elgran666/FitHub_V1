    <p class="infohub-modal-text">Building muscle is not just about lifting heavy weights—it’s about understanding the
        science of muscle growth and nutrition. Let’s unlock the secrets to gaining substantial muscle mass effectively.
    </p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">The Foundations of Muscle Growth</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">Muscle growth occurs as a response to physical stress. When you exercise, especially
        during weight lifting or resistance training, you create small tears in muscle fibers. The body repairs these
        fibers by fusing them, which increases the mass and size of muscles.</p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Caloric Surplus: Fueling Growth</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">While a balanced diet is crucial, muscle growth typically requires a caloric
        surplus—consuming more calories than you burn. This extra energy supports the body in building new muscle
        tissue. However, beginners can experience muscle gains even in a caloric deficit thanks to the body’s adaptive
        response to new stimuli.</p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Protein: The Building Block of Muscle</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">Protein is vital for muscle repair and growth. Consuming approximately 1.5 grams of
        protein per kilogram of body weight is essential for effective muscle synthesis. This macronutrient serves as
        the building block for muscle and is crucial in the protein biosynthesis process.</p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Additional Tips for Enhanced Muscle Growth</h4>
    <ul class="infohub-modal-text">
        </class>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Regular training sessions are key. Aim for at least three times a week to
            effectively stimulate muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety in Training:</strong> Vary your exercise routine to target different muscle groups and avoid
            plateaus. Incorporating both compound and isolation exercises can yield comprehensive growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Muscles need time to heal and grow. Ensure adequate rest and get enough
            sleep to facilitate muscle recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="infohub-modal-text">By understanding and applying these fundamental principles, you can optimize your
        muscle growth and achieve impressive gains, just like the pros.</p>
