    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Weight Loss Simplified</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">Losing weight boils down to an essential principle: calorie balance. It's about the
        energy you consume versus the energy you expend. Here’s how you can harness this principle to shed unwanted
        weight effectively.</p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Calorie Deficit: The Gateway to Weight Loss</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">To lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit—this means consuming fewer
        calories than your body burns. Roughly 7,700 calories equal about 1 kilogram of body fat. So, to lose that 1
        kilogram, you need to create a deficit of 7,700 calories over a period, either by eating less or moving more.
    </p>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">Two Main Strategies to Achieve Calorie Deficit</h4>
    <ul class="infohub-modal-text">
        <li><strong>Decrease Caloric Intake:</strong> Eating fewer calories doesn’t have to mean eating less food. Opt
            for foods that are less calorie-dense, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which fill you up with
            fewer calories.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase Physical Activity:</strong> Boosting your activity levels can increase the number of
            calories your body uses for energy. Incorporate more movement into your day, whether it’s a brisk walk, a
            dance class, or a heavy lifting session at the gym.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="infohub-modal-header">The Role of Food Choices in Weight Loss</h4>
    <p class="infohub-modal-text">What you eat is just as important as how much you eat. Foods high in sugar can lead to
        energy spikes followed by a crash, which can prompt more hunger and overeating. Choosing foods with a lower
        calorie density and that are high in nutrients can help manage hunger and sustain energy levels throughout the
        day.</p>

    <p class="infohub-modal-text">Understanding these principles and applying them can help you manage your weight
        effectively, ensuring that you not only lose weight but do so in a healthy, sustainable way.</p>

<!-- Suggested Visual -->
<!-- You might include a visual, like a chart or a graph, illustrating the concept of calorie deficit. Another effective visual could be before-and-after images of meals, showing a high-calorie meal and its healthier, lower-calorie alternative. This visual contrast can effectively convey the impact of food choices on calorie intake. -->
