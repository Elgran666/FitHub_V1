--> cleanup needed!

IDEAS FUTURE FEATURES:

- strength tracker for bench/deadlift/squat
    OR
- training diary a la "Strong" app


- calorie tracker
    - similar to fat secret / myfitnesspal
        --> would require A LOT of work i guess?
        --> calendar function
        --> api from fat secret / myfitnesspal
        --> meals: breakfast, lucnh, dinner, snacks

- login:
    - proper password validation
    - login with google
    - overall better login / signup experience (even though its pretty good already)


- if it ever went live properly:
    - some sort of streak for the user to comee back like duolingo
        - could give streaks for tracking food, achieving workout goals per week etc.
    - give more dopamin rewards for "good behavior" (streaks) but also generally more
        things that are rewarding or give the feeling of a reward such as robinhood does
        for example when a trade gets opened (confetti shows up on the screen and gamifies it a bit)
